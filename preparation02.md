## Who
My prefered name is Val Mcilvaine (Mac- ill- vein). I use She/they pronouns.

## Why

I think my ideal occupation is working as a biostatistican for a health network. However, I am still open to wokring in a non-health feild doing data analyatics for a comapny. I do not want to work in insurance. I have an internship this summer at Mary Free Bed, and I am hoping that this wil help me deciede if I want to to work for a health system. I am taking this class in hopes that I will become confident in my R skills. Up to this point, I have only used SAS in my courses. I have become pretty good at SAS but want to learn R since a lot of non-health companies use it. Also, I think it wil be nice to have a project that I can put on my resume and talk about in interviews.

I am not currently follwing anyone that is doing what I want to be doing in the future, but I am going to try to find someone through social media.
